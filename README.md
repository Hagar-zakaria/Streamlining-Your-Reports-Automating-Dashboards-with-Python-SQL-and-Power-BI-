# Streamlining Your Reports: Automating Dashboards with Python, SQL, and Power BI

As a data analyst, this is one of the most interesting projects you'll work on because you'll see how business metrics change in real-time. In the real world, companies receive new data daily, so dynamic dashboard reports are essential.

## What Are Dynamic Dashboard Reports?

Dynamic dashboard reports are essentially real-time snapshots of data that reflect the latest updates or changes in a database.

For example, let's consider an online store. Yesterday, it received 2500 orders, but today it received 2800 orders. A static dashboard would only display the total number of orders from the previous day (2500). However, a dynamic dashboard report would show the most recent data, indicating that the store received 2800 orders today. It can also illustrate the growth in the number of orders between the previous day and the current day.

Imagine you're viewing such a dashboard in your business intelligence tool. Once you refresh the dashboard page, the dynamic report immediately reflects the most recent changes in the data. This capability ensures that users always have access to the latest information, allowing for better-informed decisions and insights.

Dynamic dashboard reports are crucial for tracking key business growth metrics such as customer churn/retention rate, revenue growth/decline, and new customer count on various time scales like daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.

In this project, I'll be creating a dynamic dashboard report using data from a cryptocurrency web API. This API offers data on the revenue generated by multiple cryptocurrency projects each day.

The project aims to analyze revenue growth over time, daily revenue, monitor the active cryptocurrency projects generating revenue daily, and track the 24-hour revenue change.

Here's an example of the report we'll generate daily.

### Importing Needed Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import sqlalchemy
import os
import requests
from datetime import date
from sqlalchemy import MetaData
from sqlalchemy import Table, Column, Integer, String, Numeric
from sqlalchemy.dialects.mysql import VARCHAR
import pyodbc


### Getting Current Date Because the Doesn't Come With a Date Column
```python
from datetime import date

now = date.today()
todays_date = now.strftime('%Y/%m/%d')
todays_date
